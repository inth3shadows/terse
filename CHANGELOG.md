# Changelog

All notable changes to terse are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Releases are cut from git tags (`vX.Y.Z`, via hatch-vcs) — an entry moves from
`[Unreleased]` to a versioned section when its tag is pushed.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`drop-to-retrieve` for non-JSON payloads, addressed by span.** A policy field can now
  name `"$text.code_blocks"`, which evicts each fenced code block over `min` chars from a
  long-text tool result to a `terse.retrieve` handle while leaving the surrounding prose
  resident. This reaches a payload class the lossless codec structurally cannot help with:
  measured over 60 real captured `codegraph_explore` results, 89.2% of their tokens were
  fenced source and terse saved **0.0%**; with the selector enabled the same corpus drops
  **87.0%** of its tokens, with byte-exact restore verified on all 57 transformed payloads
  and zero gate failures. Opt-in and off by default — no existing policy changes behavior.
  The gate is stronger than its JSON sibling's: rather than proving only marked paths
  changed, it reconstructs the entire payload from the emitted text plus the session store
  and requires byte-for-byte equality. Suppressed on never-lossy servers, by `critical`,
  and by `"tiers": []`, each with an explicit warning rather than silence. The behavioral
  fluency harness (`dropeval`) gained the matching text recall/precision questions.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- Automated PyPI publishing via GitHub Actions **Trusted Publishing** (OIDC) with
  PEP 740 provenance attestations — tagged releases upload to PyPI with no stored
  token. This is the first PyPI release of `terse-mcp`. (#111)

### Fixed
- `release` workflow: corrected the built-wheel name check for the `terse-mcp`
  rename (`terse_mcp-*.whl`), which had blocked the tagged release run. (#110)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- **Installable package** — MIT license and PyPI-ready metadata. The distribution is
  named `terse-mcp` (the bare `terse` is taken on PyPI); the import package stays
  `terse`, so `python -m terse` is unchanged. (#103)
- `verify --json`: emit the lossless-gate verdict and cl100k savings totals as JSON
  on stdout instead of the markdown report — CI-checkable (`… | jq -e
  .lossless_gate.ok`), parity with `stats --json` / `mcp-status --json`. (#107)
- diff-moat instrumentation: `stats` records why the cross-call diff tier did or did
  not fire per call, to measure the diff feature's real-world reach (Phase 0+1). (#101)
- Property-based fuzzing of the lossless round-trip guarantee. (#105)

### Documentation
- Onboarding quickstart + per-client install recipes. (#108)
- Codeshot architecture diagram embedded in TECHNICAL.md. (#104)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added
- `mcp-status`: each wrapped server now shows what it actually fronts
  (`wraps=<downstream cmd/url>`), whether the cross-call diff tier is
  on/off/default, and whether the stats ledger is on; a policy file that has gone
  missing since install is flagged `(MISSING)`; new `--json` output for
  scripts/CI. (#97)
- `tune`: each drop-candidate bucket ends with a savings rollup — estimated gross
  tokens the whole bucket would evict and its share of the corpus. (#98)
- `fluency --html`: writes the forest-plot comprehension-gap report next to
  `--out` for the paired diff-family evals (`--diff`, `--diff-soak`,
  `--text-diff-eval`); same inline-SVG/no-JS/no-CDN form as `measure --html`. (#99)

### Fixed
- `stats`: the per-tool table falls back to character columns when tiktoken token
  counts are absent (was rendering as all-zeros); an empty `--since` window now
  reports the window rather than "nothing ever recorded"; added a per-tool
  cross-call diff hit-rate (`diff%`) column. (#96)

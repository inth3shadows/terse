"""#168: the primer is charged per wrapped server per TURN and the ledger never sees it.

The ledger charges terse for the payloads it compresses and never for the context it adds,
so `terse stats` could report a win in a session that was a net loss — measured from outside
terse as a 14.0% win at one wrapped server and a 2.1% LOSS at three.

What is deliberately NOT built here is a per-turn charge in the ledger: `turns` is not
observable from a stdio proxy, and inventing one would be the #144/#186/#188 defect family
again — a number describing something the code never measured. These tests pin the
break-even framing that replaces it, and the two ways sizing it can quietly lie: counting
from the ledger (which cannot see the install that is pure cost) and mistaking "unknown" for
"never called".

"""Spike report: token delta per shape bucket with tier attribution.

Honesty requirements (plan Section 7, principle #24):
  - every shape bucket is shown, including near-zero / negative ones — never
    averaged away into a single headline number
  - coverage (which tools, how many payloads) is a first-class section, so a thin
    sample cannot read as "nothing to compress"
  - the lossless gate result gates the whole report: any round-trip failure prints
    an INVALID banner, because savings on top of lost data are meaningless
